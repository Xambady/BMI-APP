      Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. You should not use this tool if you, or the person you are using it for is under 18 years old, pregnant, has been diagnosed with eating disorder, or have a condition that affects their height. <br/><br/>
      NOTE: The ethnic background selection is underdevelopment.
      <!-- NOTE: The calculator will also ask for information on your ethnic background. This is because people from an Asian, Black African, African-Caribbean or Middle Eastern ethnic background have a higher chance of developing health problems at a lower BMI. When you enter information on your ethnic background, the calculator will give you more accurate advice about your BMI result. -->
